echo "=================="
echo
echo "1. üëë CREATOR SCENARIO"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Open the URL above in your main browser"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Login with Internet Identity - you'll be the creator"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ You'll have 1,000,000 EDU tokens initially"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Try the 'Mint' tab to create more tokens"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Use 'Transfer' tab to send tokens to other users"
echo
echo "2. üë§ REGULAR USER SCENARIO"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Open the same URL in an incognito/private window"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Login with a different Internet Identity"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ You'll start with 0 tokens"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Copy your Principal ID from the header"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Ask the creator to mint some tokens to your Principal ID"
echo
echo "3. üîç EXPLORER TESTING"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Use the 'Token Explorer' tab to see all users"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Search for specific Principal IDs"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Notice the creator has a special 'Creator' badge"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Check balance distribution and percentages"
echo
echo "4. üí∞ BALANCE CHECKER"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Use 'Check Balance' to look up any user's balance"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Try your own Principal ID"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Try other users' Principal IDs"
echo
echo "5. üì§ TRANSFER TESTING"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ As the creator, transfer tokens to new users"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ As a regular user, transfer tokens between accounts"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Try invalid scenarios (insufficient balance, same account)"
echo
echo "üí° Testing Tips:"
echo "==============="
echo "‚Ä¢ Use different browser profiles for different users"
echo "‚Ä¢ Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+N (incognito), Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+P (private)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Each Internet Identity creates a unique Principal ID"
echo "‚Ä¢ Copy Principal IDs carefully - they're case-sensitive"
echo "‚Ä¢ Watch the real-time updates after each transaction"
echo "‚Ä¢ Check the browser console for detailed error messages"
echo
echo "üéØ What to Test:"
echo "==============="
echo "‚úì Internet Identity login/logout"
echo "‚úì Token explorer shows all users correctly"
echo "‚úì Balance checking works for any Principal ID"
echo "‚úì Transfers work between different users"
echo "‚úì Minting only works for the creator"
echo "‚úì Error handling for invalid operations"
echo "‚úì Real-time UI updates after transactions"
echo "‚úì Responsive design on different screen sizes"
